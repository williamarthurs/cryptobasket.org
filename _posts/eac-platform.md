## Introduction

EAC PLATFORM plans to carry out a project to realize all education inside and outside of school, which is essential for all children around the world to grow as essential talents in the 21st century, in the metaverse space by introducing the following technologies.

Even though the technology that can help learning has been developed, most of the learning still takes place in offline learning centers, private lessons, or video services such as YouTube. Also in terms of timing, during the lockdown brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic that began in 2020, there was a change in learning trend that learning took place exclusively through video media.

## Features

1. The Meta-Economy service layer is a sharing-based, user-based service providing an organic role that breathes life into the platform to enable its own growth.
2. We designed a service layer consisting of a special point system that stimulates the growth, maintenance and development of the platform, and the desire for vigorous development of users active in the platform.
3. We present a service platform based on cultural education using decentralized blockchain technology to make it a more advanced platform. META-Universe blockchain is designed to use ‘cross chains’ that support key functions in order to promptly establish an ecosystem and minimize trial and error.
4. It is a wallet that supports the safe storage and transfer of all coins provided on the platform. In addition to basic functions such as transaction and remittance based on the dApp, a platform for coin exchange with other users (P2P) or at the exchange market shall also be provided in v2.0, thereby evolving into MeXchange platform that users can access more easily.
